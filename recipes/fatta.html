    <h2>A celebration dish that blends crispy bread, fluffy rice, and tender meat soaked in garlicky vinegar broth.</h2>
    <p>Fatta is one of Egypt’s most iconic feast dishes, often prepared during Eid and special family occasions. 
        It combines layers of toasted baladi bread, fragrant rice, and slow-cooked meat, all brought together with a tangy garlic-vinegar sauce. 
        The result is a comforting, hearty meal that balances crunch, softness, and rich flavor in every bite.</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients:-</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g beef or lamb, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups Egyptian rice</li>
        <li>2 pieces baladi bread (or pita), cut into small squares</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ghee or butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth (from boiling the meat)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps:-</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the meat:</strong> Cook the beef or lamb with onions, salt, pepper, and bay leaves until tender. Reserve the broth for later.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the bread:</strong> In a pan, fry the baladi bread pieces in ghee or butter until golden and crispy. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the rice:</strong> Prepare the rice separately in ghee or butter until fluffy and well done.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Sauté minced garlic in ghee, then add vinegar and tomato paste to form a rich, tangy base.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend the flavors:</strong> Mix part of the reserved broth into the garlic-vinegar sauce to thin and infuse flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble layers:</strong> Place crispy bread at the bottom of a dish, pour some broth to soften it, then add a layer of rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the meat:</strong> Arrange the cooked meat pieces evenly over the rice layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong> Drizzle the remaining garlic-vinegar sauce on top just before serving for a perfect final touch.</li>
    </ol>
