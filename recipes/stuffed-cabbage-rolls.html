    <h2>Tender cabbage leaves filled with aromatic rice, herbs, and spices, simmered in a rich tomato sauce. A comforting Egyptian classic that turns humble ingredients into a soulful meal.</h2>
    <p>Egyptian Stuffed Cabbage Rolls are made by wrapping lightly blanched cabbage leaves around a savory rice filling infused with onions, herbs, and tomato. Once rolled, the bundles are neatly packed in a pot, topped with tomato sauce, and left to simmer gently until the flavors meld beautifully. This dish is warm, fragrant, and deeply satisfying — a staple of Egyptian home cooking that brings families together around the table.</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients:-</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium cabbage</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, grated or blended</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh dill and parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee</li>
        <li>200 g minced beef or lamb for a meat version</li>
        <li>3 cups tomato juice or diluted tomato paste for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps:-</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cabbage:</strong> Boil a large pot of water and gently separate the cabbage leaves, blanching each for about 1–2 minutes until pliable. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the stuffing:</strong> In a bowl, mix rice, onion, herbs, tomato paste, grated tomato, oil, salt, pepper, and cumin. Add minced meat if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the rolls:</strong> Cut thick veins from the center of each cabbage leaf. Place a spoonful of filling on the edge and roll tightly, folding the sides inward.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange in the pot:</strong> Line the bottom with unused cabbage leaves, then layer the rolls neatly. Pour tomato juice over until the rolls are just covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 45–60 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and the sauce is thickened.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving warm with extra tomato sauce or a squeeze of lemon.</li>
